# MailboxProcessor.TryScan<'Msg,'T> Method (F#)

Scans for a message by looking through messages in arrival order until a provided function returns a **Some** value. Other messages remain in the queue.

**Namespace/Module Path:** Microsoft.FSharp.Control

**Assembly:** FSharp.Core (in FSharp.Core.dll)


## Syntax

```
// Signature:
member this.TryScan : ('Msg -> Async<'T> option) * ?int -> Async<'T option>

// Usage:
mailboxProcessor.TryScan (scanner)
mailboxProcessor.TryScan (scanner, timeout = timeout)
```

#### Parameters
*scanner*
Type: **'Msg -&gt;**[Async](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e0b28ea2-dea5-4021-b2b9-d7d4761babde)**&lt;'T&gt;**[option](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b08add48-34bf-4410-80a1-ef6a8daddc58)


A function that returns **None** if the message is to be skipped, or **Some** if the message is to be processed and removed from the queue.


*timeout*
Type: [int](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/025d5455-3622-4ea5-9573-3ecbd4ee1375)


An optional timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to -1 which corresponds to **F:System.Threading.Timeout.Infinite**.



**An asynchronous computation ([Async](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/03eb4d12-a01a-4565-a077-5e83f17cf6f7) object) that scanner built off the read message.**
## Remarks
If a timeout period is exceeded, **None** is returned. This method is for use within the body of the agent. For each agent, at most one concurrent reader can be active, so no more than one concurrent call to [Receive](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/46a1d8e6-3906-45c2-9722-0ddab574cc6a), [TryReceive](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/edcb3930-cefd-4d88-935d-7dd6297355ee), [Scan](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e86368a3-4f97-4b51-a487-4c6b5456fcbe) or **TryScan** can be active. The body of the *scanner* function is locked during its execution, but the lock is released before the execution of the asynchronous workflow.

**The following code example shows how to use the TryScan method. This example is a job submission agent. There are three agents: one called runAgent that starts each job, another called inprogressAgent that represents all running jobs, and one called completeAgent that represents notification that a job is completed. TryScan is used in the cancelJob function to find a job to cancel, or fail if there is no matching job.**
